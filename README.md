# Expense Calculator

In this app we will be building a personal expense calculator.

In the <code>input#expense-input</code>, expenditure will be written in format 
<code>itemName - itemPrice</code> and that entry will be added to the <code>div#expense-list</code> upon clicking the <code>button#expense-button</code>.
The item will be added to the bottom of the list.
The total expenditure will be displayed in the <code>div#total-expense</code> in format  <code>Total Expense: {totalPrice}</code>.
